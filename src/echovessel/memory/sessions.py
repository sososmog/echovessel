"""Session boundary management.

A Session is an internal unit of extraction, NOT a user-visible concept.
The user experiences "one continuous conversation", the system decides when
to close a session for extraction purposes based on:

    IDLE: idle > SESSION_IDLE_MINUTES minutes
    MAX_LENGTH: messages > SESSION_MAX_MESSAGES or tokens > SESSION_MAX_TOKENS
    EXPLICIT: user clicked a "goodbye" (not in MVP)
    LIFECYCLE: app close, etc. (handled by runtime layer, not here)

Sessions are sharded by (persona_id, user_id, channel_id). Each channel's
lifecycle signals fire independently — see docs/DISCUSSION.md 2026-04-14 D6.
The channel sharding applies ONLY to session boundaries; downstream memory
(L3/L4) is unified across channels and never filtered by channel at retrieve
time (D4).

See docs/memory/02-architecture-v0.3.md §3.4.

# --- Round 4: lifecycle fire tracking --------------------------------------
#
# Memory writes happen across multiple functions (get_or_create_open_session
# flushes new Session rows; ingest_message commits; consolidate_session marks
# CLOSED and commits). The lifecycle hooks MUST fire strictly AFTER commit
# (tracker §4 rule 7), so the creator can't fire immediately — the
# committing caller has to.
#
# We use a tiny module-level pending list to relay new-session / closed-
# session events between creator and committer without changing any
# existing function signature. The committing caller drains it via
# `drain_and_fire_pending_lifecycle_events()` right after `db.commit()`.
#
# This is single-threaded-only (SQLite MVP is single-writer). A future
# concurrent backend would need a ContextVar instead; that's v1.x.
