"""RETRIEVE pipeline — what goes into the prompt before each response.

Per architecture v0.3 §3.2:

    1. L1 (core blocks) always in prompt, unconditional
    2. Unified L3+L4 query on concept_nodes, filtered by type IN (event, thought)
    3. Rerank with score = 0.5*recency + 3*relevance + 2*impact + 1*relational_bonus
    4. Top-K returned
    5. Optional session expansion via L2 JOIN when an event needs context
    6. L2 FTS fallback when L3/L4 returns too few hits or an explicit query

Accepts an `embed_fn` callable so the memory module stays decoupled from
any specific embedding provider.

🚨 铁律 · Memory retrieval NEVER filters by channel_id · DISCUSSION.md D4 🚨

This entire file must not contain any `WHERE channel_id = ...` clause —
not in vector_search, not in FTS fallback, not in session context expansion,
not in L1 loading. A real human in a group chat still remembers every
private conversation; memory knows everything. Deciding what to VOICE in a
given channel is the job of Interaction Policy (the output layer), not this
module.

Adding a channel filter here would:
  - make persona "forget" in one channel what it knew in another
  - break the "single psyche across channels" contract
  - require the whole retrieval stack to be rewritten when group chat lands
  - undo the reason single_psyche_A was chosen in the first place

Code review red flag: if any retrieve diff introduces a channel filter,
reject it and refer to docs/DISCUSSION.md 2026-04-14 D4.
