"""Memory-side event observer Protocol.

Defines a lightweight notification contract that higher layers (runtime)
can register against without memory needing to know what they'll do.

Memory **never** imports runtime / channels / voice / proactive. Instead,
callers implement `MemoryEventObserver` and pass an instance to the write
APIs (ingest_message / consolidate_session / import_content), or more
typically register a singleton via `register_observer` that memory fires
through its own lifecycle path.

Contract (review M2 / M3):

- Observers are one-way notifications fired **after a successful commit**
- Observer exceptions MUST NOT roll back the memory write — callers
  catch + log + continue
- Observers are sync (matching the rest of the memory write APIs)
- Adding new hooks is additive; existing Protocol consumers stay valid

Two hook flavours live in the same Protocol:

1. **Per-write hooks (round 3)** — `on_message_ingested` /
   `on_event_created` / `on_thought_created` / `on_core_block_appended`.
   Fired per-call via an explicit `observer=` keyword argument passed to
   the individual write API (`ingest_message`, `bulk_create_events`,
   `append_to_core_block`, …). Used by import pipeline / tests / callers
   that only care about their own write's outcome.

2. **Lifecycle hooks (round 4)** — `on_new_session_started` /
   `on_session_closed` / `on_mood_updated`. Fired through the
   module-level `_observers` registry, which runtime populates once via
   `register_observer(...)` at daemon startup. These are global-ish
   notifications that any consumer (runtime SSE bridge, tests) can
   subscribe to without needing to thread an `observer=` param through
   every caller.

The two flavours co-exist on one Protocol so a single consumer object
(typically `RuntimeMemoryObserver` in runtime/memory_observers.py) can
implement whichever hooks it cares about and the Protocol structural
check still holds via NullObserver-style no-ops for the rest.
