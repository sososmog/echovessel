"""Forgetting rights — the user's right to remove memories from the system.

Implements the three deletion paths from architecture v0.3 §4.12:

    4.12.1 Delete L2 message → mark L3 source_deleted (no re-extraction)
    4.12.2 Delete L3 event → interactive cascade:
              - Case A: no L4 dependents → simple soft delete
              - Case B: has dependents → return a DeletionPreview for user
                choice (cascade / orphan / cancel)
    4.12.3 "Forget event, keep lesson" → handled automatically by orphan path

All deletes are SOFT (set deleted_at). Physical cleanup happens via a
separate cron job 30 days later (not implemented yet — v1.1).
