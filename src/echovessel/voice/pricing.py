"""Hard-coded TTS cost estimates for `VoiceService.generate_voice()`.

This is the "方案 Z" implementation of review R3.4 (see voice spec
§4.7a · Cost estimation). It deliberately does NOT call any provider
billing API and does NOT read any config file — the whole point is to
give the user a rough order-of-magnitude hint without taking a
dependency on provider dashboards.

The authoritative bill lives on the provider's own dashboard. Web UI
surfaces values derived from this module MUST label them "估算值"
(spec §4.7a + Web channel spec §3.4).

Rates below are documented in the voice spec (docs/voice/01-spec-v0.1.md
§4.7a, dated 2026-04-16). Update both places together when re-checking
FishAudio pricing.

    - `provider` is the opaque label returned by `TTSProvider.provider_name`.

      `0.0` so the caller can still assemble a `VoiceResult` without
      crashing. The warning path exists so a future provider drop-in is
      visible in logs instead of silently free.

    meaningful because the rates are rough estimates to begin with.
