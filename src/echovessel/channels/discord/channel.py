"""Discord DM channel — Channel Protocol v0.2 implementation.

Satisfies :class:`echovessel.channels.base.Channel` for direct messages
received via the official ``discord.py`` library. The state machine is
the same debounce pattern used by :class:`WebChannel` — see the big
block comment in ``push_user_message`` below for the spec reference.

Scope (tracker §5)
------------------

Included:

- Direct-message ingestion via a bundled ``discord.py`` client
- Per-turn debounce with the M1 iron rule (``next_turn`` promotes via
  a normal debounce cycle, never instant flush)
- DM reply routing keyed by persona-side ``user_id``
- Optional allowlist of Discord snowflakes to gate incoming DMs
- Hard upper bounds on per-turn message count / char count

Deferred to later rounds:

- Guild channels, slash commands, voice attachments, reactions
- SSE-style ``push_sse`` capability (Discord has no SSE)
- Auto-reconnect strategy beyond whatever ``discord.py`` does by
  default

Concurrent editing notes (why this is a verbatim copy of WebChannel's
state machine)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Stage 2 (Web FastAPI + SSE) is editing
``src/echovessel/channels/web/channel.py`` in parallel with this
change. To avoid merge conflicts in ``channels/base.py`` and in the
WebChannel file itself, the debounce state machine is **duplicated**
into this file. Main thread will extract a shared ``DebounceState``
helper in a follow-up cleanup round after both Stage 2 and Stage 6
land. The duplication is intentional and documented.

    Owns a debounce state machine (same shape as
    :class:`echovessel.channels.web.channel.WebChannel`) that groups
    DM messages into :class:`IncomingTurn` bursts. Usage pattern when
    wired into runtime:

    1. ``Runtime.start()`` calls :meth:`start` which spins up a
       ``discord.py`` client on the runtime event loop.
    2. Every incoming DM is translated to an
       :class:`IncomingMessage` by :class:`DiscordBot.on_message` and
       dispatched into the state machine via :meth:`push_user_message`.
    3. The state machine debounces for ``debounce_ms`` milliseconds
       and emits an :class:`IncomingTurn` onto the internal queue.
    4. Runtime's turn dispatcher consumes turns via :meth:`incoming`.
    5. After ``assemble_turn`` completes, runtime calls
       :meth:`on_turn_done` which clears ``in_flight_turn_id`` and
       promotes ``_next_turn`` via the **normal** debounce timer.
    6. Runtime hands the reply back via :meth:`send` which resolves
       the target DM channel from the per-user mapping and forwards
       the content to Discord.

    DM routing
    ----------

    Runtime only knows a string ``user_id``; Discord needs a live
    ``discord.DMChannel`` object to send replies. The channel keeps a
    ``user_id -> discord.DMChannel`` map that is populated every time
    a DM arrives. ``_current_user_id`` tracks the author of the turn
    runtime is currently processing so :meth:`send` knows which DM
    channel to target.

    The mapping is in-process only and is lost on restart — that is
    fine because ``discord.py`` re-materialises a DM channel on
    demand whenever a new DM arrives from the same user.
