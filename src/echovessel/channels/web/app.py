"""FastAPI app factory for the Web channel (Stage 2).

Builds a FastAPI application pre-wired with:

- ``/api/chat/*`` routes from :mod:`echovessel.channels.web.routes.chat`
- A lifespan that starts the :class:`SSEBroadcaster` heartbeat task on
  startup and cancels it on shutdown
- The live :class:`WebChannel` + :class:`SSEBroadcaster` bound into
  the routes via closure — no global state

Stage 3 will add an ``admin`` router and call
``app.include_router(build_admin_router(...))`` on the same app
instance. The factory signature is designed so Stage 3 can add
optional kwargs without breaking Stage 2 callers.

The factory does NOT start the uvicorn server. That is the
runtime's responsibility — see ``echovessel.runtime.app`` Stage 2
wiring. Keeping the two concerns separate lets tests build the app
and hit it with ``httpx.AsyncClient`` without any socket binding.

    Parameters
    ----------
    channel
        Live :class:`WebChannel` instance. The factory assumes the
        caller has already attached the broadcaster via
        ``channel.attach_broadcaster(broadcaster)``.
    broadcaster
        Live :class:`SSEBroadcaster`. The factory starts the
        heartbeat task on this broadcaster in the app's lifespan.
    voice_service
        Optional :class:`VoiceService` instance. Stage 7 threads this
        to the chat router so the ``GET /api/chat/voice/{id}.mp3``
        endpoint can locate the voice cache directory. When ``None``
        (voice disabled), the endpoint returns 404.
    heartbeat_seconds
        Interval for the heartbeat broadcast. Tests can use a small
        value to exercise the heartbeat path without waiting 30s.
