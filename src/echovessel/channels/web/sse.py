"""SSE broadcast layer for the Web channel.

Stage 2 of the web v1 release (`develop-docs/web-v1/02-stage-2-tracker.md`)
introduces this module. It owns the fan-out from the in-process
``WebChannel`` to every connected browser tab holding a long-lived
``GET /api/chat/events`` SSE stream.

Design:

- Each connected client gets its own ``asyncio.Queue``. The client's
  HTTP handler drains the queue into an ``sse_starlette.EventSourceResponse``.
- ``broadcast(event, payload)`` puts the event onto every client queue
  with per-queue error isolation — one stalled or closed client must
  never block the rest of the fan-out.
- A background ``heartbeat_task`` emits ``chat.connection.heartbeat``
  frames so reverse proxies and browsers keep the SSE stream open
  during long silences.

The broadcaster is deliberately transport-agnostic: it only speaks
``{"event": str, "data": dict}`` dicts. The FastAPI route layer in
``routes/chat.py`` is the only place that knows about
``sse_starlette`` and ``EventSourceResponse``.
