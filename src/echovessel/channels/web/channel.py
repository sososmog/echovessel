"""Web channel core — debounce state machine and lifecycle stubs.

Stage 1 of the web v1 release (``develop-docs/web-v1/01-stage-1-tracker.md``)
delivers the non-transport half of the web channel: an in-memory
debounce state machine that implements the Channel Protocol v0.2 shape
described in ``develop-docs/channels/01-spec-v0.1.md`` §2.3a.

What is here:

- The :class:`WebChannel` class itself, satisfying
  :class:`echovessel.channels.base.Channel`
- A fully-working debounce state machine with ``current_turn`` /
  ``next_turn`` buffers and a ``call_later``-driven flush timer
- ``push_user_message`` as the single entry point for Stage 2's
  FastAPI ``POST /api/chat/send`` route (and for the Stage 1 tests)
- A stub ``send`` that appends to a ``sent`` list — Stage 2 replaces
  this with SSE fan-out

What is NOT here (deferred to later stages per tracker §5):

- FastAPI app factory, HTTP routes, SSE broadcast (Stage 2)
- Admin API for first-launch detection and persona voice toggle
  (Stage 3)
- Any frontend changes (Stage 4)
- Discord / iMessage / WeChat transport (Stage 6)
- Voice delivery wiring beyond the ``OutgoingMessage.delivery`` field
  (Stage 7)

    """Channel Protocol v0.2 implementation for the local Web transport.

    The channel owns a debounce state machine that groups user messages
    into :class:`IncomingTurn` bursts. Usage:

    1. Something (Stage 2: a FastAPI route handler) calls
       :meth:`push_user_message` for each arriving message.
    2. The state machine accumulates messages into ``_current_turn``
       and schedules a flush after ``debounce_ms``.
    3. When the timer fires (or a hard limit is hit), the buffer is
       emitted as an :class:`IncomingTurn` onto the internal queue.
    4. The runtime's turn dispatcher consumes the turn via
       :meth:`incoming` and drives ``assemble_turn``.
    5. When the LLM finishes, runtime calls :meth:`on_turn_done`.
       If messages arrived during generation (``_next_turn`` non-empty),
       they are promoted back into ``_current_turn`` and scheduled via
       the **normal** debounce timer — not flushed immediately.

    The state machine is single-threaded (one event loop) and therefore
    needs no locking. Runtime's ``on_turn_done`` call is routed through
    the same event loop as ``push_user_message`` so the internal buffers
    are only mutated from one coroutine context.

    ``send`` is a Stage 1 stub: it appends the :class:`OutgoingMessage`
    to ``self.sent``. Tests assert on ``self.sent`` and Stage 2 replaces
    this method with real SSE fan-out.
