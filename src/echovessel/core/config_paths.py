"""Canonical allowlists for the admin ``PATCH /api/admin/config`` route.

The constants live in the core layer (not runtime) so both the runtime
config loader and the channels/web admin route can import them without
breaking the layered-architecture contract
(``runtime → channels|proactive → memory|voice → core``).

Each path is a ``section.field`` string matching the Pydantic schema in
:mod:`echovessel.runtime.config`. Keep the two sets disjoint — a path
cannot be both hot-reloadable and restart-required.
