"""Bounded event queue with MAX_EVENTS hard cap (spec §2.5).

Why an explicit cap:

1. **Prevent LLM context explosion** — airi's `planner/llm-client.ts` L49
   stuffs unread event counts into the prompt; unbounded queues let a
   single noisy channel blow past the model's context window.
2. **Prevent single-channel starvation** — without a cap, one noisy
   channel's session_closed events can monopolise the queue and block
   other signals forever.

Overflow policy: when full, drop the OLDEST non-critical event. Critical
events (SHOCK-grade memory.event_extracted with |impact|>=8, relationship
changes) are never dropped — they survive the overflow and kick earlier
non-critical entries out. If every event in the queue is critical, the
newly-pushed event is dropped instead (critical events form a fixed-size
ring buffer at the back of the queue).

This module is pure Python (collections.deque). No threading primitives:
the scheduler runs in a single asyncio event loop, so ``notify`` and the
tick loop never race on the queue.
