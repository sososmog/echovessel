Runtime's round-2 patch will import ``build_proactive_scheduler`` and call
it once at startup with the concrete dependencies it has on hand.

The factory is intentionally thin — it only does dependency wiring, not
discovery. Everything is injected.

    """Wire up all the subcomponents and return a ready-to-start scheduler.

    Parameters:
        config: Validated ProactiveConfig (runtime loads it from the
            ``[proactive]`` TOML section).
        memory_api: Any object matching the MemoryApi Protocol. In
            production this is a thin facade over memory/retrieve.py
            + memory/ingest.py that the runtime owns.
        channel_registry: Runtime-owned registry. Proactive does not
            manage channel lifecycle — it just asks for the currently
            enabled set every tick.
        proactive_fn: Async callable built by
            ``runtime/prompts_wiring.py::make_proactive_fn(llm_provider)``.
            See spec §5.1. LLM tier = LARGE is baked in on the
            runtime side; this module does not pass a tier argument.
        persona: PersonaView with ``voice_enabled`` + ``voice_id``
            properties. v0.2 · review Check 3 — proactive reads these at
            tick time so admin toggles apply on the next tick. When
            None, voice path is always off (text-only, graceful default
            matching "no voice_enabled means no voice").
        voice_service: Optional. If None, proactive runs pure-text
            throughout (spec §10.3). If provided, must satisfy the
            VoiceServiceProtocol duck type (``generate_voice`` method).
        is_turn_in_flight: Optional predicate for the v0.2
            ``no_in_flight_turn`` policy gate (spec §3.5a · review
            M5). Runtime's RT-round3 patch injects a closure that
            scans its channel registry for any enabled channel with
            ``in_flight_turn_id is not None``. When None, the gate
            is permissive (never blocks) — matching the spec's
            "no channel readable → no in-flight turn" rule.
        audit_sink: Optional override. Defaults to a JSONLAuditSink
            writing to ``log_dir`` (default ~/.echovessel/logs).
        log_dir: Directory for the JSONL audit file. Ignored if
            audit_sink is provided.
        clock: Injected datetime provider for testing. Defaults to
            ``datetime.now``.
        shutdown_event: Optional asyncio.Event the runtime uses to
            signal shutdown; the scheduler also has its own stop()
            method that sets an internal flag.
