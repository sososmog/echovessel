"""Runtime-side adapters that translate between memory/channel APIs and
the Protocols the proactive subsystem expects.

Two jobs in one file:

1. **`MemoryFacade`** · implements `echovessel.proactive.base.MemoryApi`
   by delegating to the existing `echovessel.memory` public API. The
   memory layer exposes free functions that take `DbSession` as the
   first argument; the proactive layer expects a stateful object that
   manages DB access internally. The facade is the bridge.

2. **`ProactiveChannelRegistry` + `_ProactiveChannelAdapter`** · wraps
   the runtime's in-memory `ChannelRegistry` into the shape proactive
   expects (`list_enabled()` returning objects with `.name` and
   `async def send(text)`). Runtime channels use a richer
   `send(envelope_ref, content)` signature; the adapter translates.

Design rules enforced here (both are tested in `test_memory_facade.py`):

- **D4 铁律**: no `channel_id=...` parameter is ever passed to a memory
  query function. The memory reads must return unified cross-channel
  data. Grep + an explicit unit test guard this.
- **No DbSession leakage**: proactive receives a MemoryFacade instance,
  not a raw DbSession. Each facade method opens its own session, runs
  the query, and closes it before returning.

Spec references:
- Voice spec §7.3.2 (runtime instantiates VoiceService before channels)
- Proactive spec §11.3 (runtime supplies MemoryApi adapter)
- DISCUSSION.md 2026-04-14 D4 (铁律: memory never filters by channel)
