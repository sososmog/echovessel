"""Runtime-side memory observer (spec §17a.5).

`RuntimeMemoryObserver` implements the memory `MemoryEventObserver`
Protocol so runtime can plug into memory's lifecycle hooks
(`on_session_closed` / `on_new_session_started` / `on_mood_updated`).

Round-β trim: the three previous SSE broadcasts
(`chat.session.boundary` / `chat.mood.update`) were dropped because no
frontend consumer listens for them. The hooks stay as Protocol-satisfying
no-ops so memory's `_fire_lifecycle` loop keeps working and future
features can reintroduce broadcast work without touching the
registration wiring in `Runtime.start()`.

See:

- docs/memory/07-round4-tracker.md §2.1 (Protocol signatures are sync)
- src/echovessel/memory/observers.py (canonical Protocol home; this
  module imports from `echovessel.memory.events`, a re-export whose
  class identity is id()-equal per round4 tracker §2.2)

    """Protocol-conforming runtime memory observer.

    Registered once in `Runtime.start()` (Step 12.5) and unregistered in
    `Runtime.stop()`. All three lifecycle hooks are intentional no-ops:
    the prior SSE broadcasts were removed when we confirmed no frontend
    listener consumes them. Memory writes still commit; nothing else
    needs to happen here.

    The class is retained (rather than deleted outright) so future work
    that does want to forward memory events out to channels can drop
    logic back into the hook bodies without rewiring the startup
