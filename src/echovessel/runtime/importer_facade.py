"""Runtime-side mediator between Web channel admin routes and the
``echovessel.import_.pipeline`` module (spec §17a.6).

## Why this exists

Both ``echovessel.channels.web`` and ``echovessel.import_.pipeline`` live
in Layer 2/3 of the layered architecture. Direct ``channels/web →
import_`` imports would be a same-layer sibling reference, which the
``lint-imports`` contract forbids. The clean resolution is:

    channels/web ──►  runtime.importer_facade  ◄── runtime
                         │
                         ▼
                    import_.pipeline

Runtime owns the facade instance (one per daemon), wires it to the
concrete ``LLMProvider`` / ``VoiceService`` / ``MemoryFacade`` dependencies
it has on hand, and injects the facade into the Web channel constructor
at Step 11. The Web channel then calls ``start_pipeline()`` /
``cancel_pipeline()`` / ``resume_pipeline()`` / ``subscribe_events()``
from its admin route handlers.

## Round 4 (Thread IMPORT-code) upgrade

As of this round the facade is no longer a stub. ``start_pipeline``
spawns an ``asyncio.create_task`` that actually invokes
``echovessel.import_.run_pipeline`` with the injected dependencies.
The pipeline emits ``PipelineEventLike`` events which the facade
translates into :class:`PipelineEvent` and fan-outs to every
subscriber queue — matching the shape the Round 3 smoke tests already
expect.

The constructor signature is unchanged from Round 3 — Thread IMPORT-code
is **not** allowed to break the channel/runtime wiring contract. Every
piece of new behaviour uses attribute probing on the injected
``memory_api`` / ``llm_provider`` so tests and the runtime can supply
richer or poorer objects as appropriate.
