"""End-to-end smoke tests for the Web channel.

Starts a real :class:`Runtime` with the Web channel enabled on a free
port, binds uvicorn, and hits the HTTP + SSE surface to verify the
full user-message → persona-reply pipeline works end to end. These
tests use the stub LLM provider and ``:memory:`` SQLite so they run
fast and require zero external network.

Tests that depend on Stage 3 admin API endpoints (``GET /api/state``,
``POST /api/admin/persona/onboarding``, ``POST
/api/admin/persona/voice-toggle``) probe for endpoint availability
with a ``GET /api/state`` call and **skip at runtime** if the admin
router is not yet registered — a concurrent worker is building
Stage 3 in parallel and these tests "activate" automatically the
moment that work lands without needing re-dispatch.

Two tests (chat roundtrip + chat retry 501) exercise the Stage 2
chat router directly and always run regardless of Stage 3 state.

Design notes:

- Port allocation uses ``socket.bind(("127.0.0.1", 0))`` to have the
  OS pick a free ephemeral port. The Stage 2 integration test pattern
  is adopted verbatim for continuity.
- Uvicorn readiness is polled via ``POST /api/chat/send`` in a tight
  loop with a 5-second deadline rather than a blind ``asyncio.sleep``.
  This guarantees the server is actually accepting connections before
  the test body runs.
- Every ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is constructed with an explicit timeout
  (``timeout=5.0`` or tighter) so a wedged uvicorn cannot hang the
  test suite indefinitely.
- SSE streams are drained through ``aiter_text`` + a substring check
  on ``event: <name>`` — the same pattern Stage 2's
  ``test_runtime_web_sse_stream_emits_connection_ready`` already
  proved works against sse_starlette.
