"""Debounce state machine tests for :class:`DiscordChannel`.

DiscordChannel copies WebChannel's debounce state machine verbatim
(see the concurrent-editing note at the top of
``src/echovessel/channels/discord/channel.py``). These tests assert
the copied behaviour matches the spec §2.3a contract independently of
WebChannel's own test suite, so a future refactor of either channel
cannot regress the shared invariants unnoticed.

The covered transitions are:

1. Single message → flush after one debounce window
2. Burst of three messages within the window → one turn
3. Message arrives while in-flight → lands in ``_next_turn``, no
   premature flush
4. ``on_turn_done`` with non-empty ``_next_turn`` → **normal** debounce
   cycle (review M1 iron rule), NOT instant flush
5. Hard per-turn message-count limit → immediate flush

Every test uses a 50 ms debounce window for fast CI; SETTLE_S adds
headroom for the ``call_later`` callback to fire cleanly.
