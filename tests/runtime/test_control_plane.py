"""Control-plane HTTP server — /health endpoint, Host middleware, bind
invariants.

Stage 1 scope:
- Server binds 127.0.0.1 on a kernel-assigned port and exposes /health
- Host header middleware rejects off-host requests with 403
- `_CONTROL_BIND_HOST` is locked to 127.0.0.1 (regression guard)
- Server shuts down cleanly via `stop_control_server`

Stage 2+ will add /shutdown and /reload — those are tested separately.
