"""Parameterised eval tests · one test per fixture YAML.

Every ``.yaml`` under ``fixtures/scripted/`` and
``fixtures/synthesized/`` becomes a separate parametrised test case.
Each run:

  1. Materialise the fixture in a fresh in-memory SQLite DB
  2. Replay turns through the real consolidate pipeline (live LLM!)
  3. Check the hard invariants declared in the YAML
  4. Ask the judge LLM each ``judge_prompts`` question

Marked ``@pytest.mark.eval`` so ``pytest`` default-skips them — run
``pytest -m eval`` to pay for a live LLM pass.
