"""Judge · ask the same LLM provider a yes/no question with evidence.

Judge is deliberately the same ``LLMProvider`` the extractor runs on,
so eval cost lives on a single account. The judge prompt is
intentionally thin: "here is the scenario + produced output · answer
YES or NO to this question · one short sentence of reasoning".

We pass ``tier=LLMTier.MEDIUM`` because eval judgements are where a
mid-tier model earns its keep — a SMALL model is too prone to rubber
stamping and a LARGE model is overkill for a binary.
