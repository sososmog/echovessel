"""Audit P1-8: import pipeline must advance ``progress.current_chunk``
even on chunk failure.

If progress doesn't advance on failure, a subsequent ``resume_pipeline``
call restarts from the failed chunk — and because memory helpers
``import_content`` / ``bulk_create_events`` commit per call, any items
that happened to land on disk before the failure (or any items from
later successful chunks, if the last chunk is the one that failed)
get re-extracted and re-written as *duplicate* rows with different
primary keys. The fix is to advance progress after every attempt so
resume picks up strictly beyond what was tried.

Trade-off that comes with the fix: a failed chunk is NOT retried on
resume. The operator has to re-import the whole file to replay it.
This matches the already-documented "partial semantics" of the
dispatch helper (see ``_dispatch_chunk_items`` docstring).
