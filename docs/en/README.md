# EchoVessel Documentation (English)

> **Audience**: developers encountering EchoVessel for the first time. This tree is clean, current, and focused on understanding and using the system today.

EchoVessel is a local-first Python daemon that runs a long-lived digital persona with hierarchical memory, voice, and multi-channel support. It is not a chatbot framework — it is a system for persistent digital presence.

---

## Getting started

**New here?** The **[First-Time Setup](./first-time-setup.md)** guide walks you from `pip install echovessel` to chatting with your first persona in the browser — about ten minutes end to end.

Quick summary for the impatient:

```bash
pip install echovessel
echovessel init         # writes ~/.echovessel/config.toml
echovessel run          # opens http://localhost:7777/ on first boot
```

`Ctrl-C` cleanly shuts the daemon down. See [`configuration.md`](./configuration.md) for every config field, and [`runtime.md`](./runtime.md) for what happens during startup.

Also: IMPORT pipeline — offline ingestion of external text into memory
```

Five core modules stacked in strict layers. **Runtime** orchestrates. **Channels** and **Proactive** sit above Memory and Voice. **Memory** and **Voice** sit above the core types. Imports flow through a separate pipeline that terminates in Memory.

## Module documentation

Each module gets exactly one page. Read in any order — pages cross-link where helpful.

| Module | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| 📖 [memory.md](./memory.md) | Hierarchical persona memory: L1 core blocks · L2 raw messages · L3 events · L4 reflections · retrieve with rerank · observer pattern for lifecycle events · idempotent schema migration |
| 🗣️ [voice.md](./voice.md) | Text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and voice cloning. Provider abstraction over FishAudio, Whisper, and stubs. `VoiceService.generate_voice()` facade with on-disk caching |
| 📡 [channels.md](./channels.md) | Channel Protocol: how external transports (web, Discord, iMessage, WeChat) plug into the daemon. Debounce state machine for burst user input. The cross-channel unified-persona design |
| ⚡ [proactive.md](./proactive.md) | Autonomous messaging. Four policy gates (quiet hours · cold user · rate limit · no-in-flight-turn). Relationship triggers. Delivery inherits from `persona.voice_enabled` |
| ⚙️ [runtime.md](./runtime.md) | The daemon. Startup sequence, turn loop with streaming, SIGHUP config reload, atomic `voice_enabled` toggle, local-first disclosure audit |
| 📥 [import.md](./import.md) | Universal LLM importer. One pipeline for any text format (diary, chat log, novel, resume). LLM-driven content-type classification into memory's 5 target categories. Mandatory embed pass |

## Design principles (the short version)

1. **Local-first**: all persona data lives on your machine. Outbound network is limited to your chosen LLM endpoint and (optionally) the voice provider. No telemetry. No phone-home.
2. **Layered architecture** (enforced by `import-linter` in CI): `runtime → channels | proactive → memory | voice → core`. A layer never imports from above.
3. **Memory is never filtered by `channel_id`.** A persona is one persona across every channel it speaks on. Retrieval, core-block loading, and recall-message queries all return the unified timeline; there is no `channel_id=` parameter anywhere in the memory read API, and there never will be.
4. **LLM prompts never leak transport identity.** System prompts, user prompts, and retrieved context blocks never contain `channel_id` or any transport-identifying token. The model has no idea whether it's on Web, Discord, or iMessage.

The deep version of each principle lives in the respective module docs.

## Status

These docs are under active development. Pages listed above are planned but most are not yet written. For anything that isn't covered here yet, read the source under `src/echovessel/` directly — every module has detailed docstrings.
